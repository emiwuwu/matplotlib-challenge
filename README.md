# Matplotlib Challenge

In this assignment, I successfully applied my knowledge of Matplotlib to analyze a real-world dataset in the context of a pharmaceutical company's study on anti-cancer medications. By generating various tables and figures, including bar plots and scatter plots, I gained insights into the performance of different drug regimens and their relationships with tumor volume, survival rates, and mouse weight, providing valuable information for the technical report of the study.
